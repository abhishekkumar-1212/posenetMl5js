# posenetMl5js
This project utilizes Pose Net for detecting human skeleton posture using p5.js and TensorFlow.js through the ml5.js library. The application identifies and visualizes the key points of a human skeleton in real-time, providing a foundation for various posture-related applications such as fitness tracking, motion analysis.
Features:
Real-time Human Skeleton Detection: Leveraging PoseNet model for accurate and efficient detection.
Interactive Visualization: Provides a visual representation of the detected skeleton using p5.js.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs in any modern web browser with support for WebGL and TensorFlow.js.
